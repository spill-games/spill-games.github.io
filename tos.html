AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before bringing a formal legal case, you must first contact our Customer Support team through support@spill.games. In the event that you and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited can&rsquo;t resolve the dispute through Customer Support, you and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited both agree to arbitrate as described below.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your agreement to these Terms), you and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, Feature Terms including but not limited to your use of the Services and information you provide via the Services, through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all claims under any legal theory unless the claim fits within the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate identified below. This agreement to arbitrate also applies even after you stop using your account or delete it. (In this Section 14 and in Section 16, you and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited may be referred to individually as &ldquo;a party&rdquo; or collectively as &ldquo;the parties.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you, and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury. Arbitrations have different rules from lawsuits in court. They are less formal than lawsuits in courts and provide limited opportunities to force the other side to share information relevant to the dispute&mdash;a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if any party does not like the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If any party disagrees about whether this Section 14 (or any portion of this Section 14 including without limitation the provisions relating to arbitration, class action waiver, and opting out) can be enforced or whether it applies to the dispute, the parties all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, if you or Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated, or any party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, any other party can ask a court to force the parties to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You or Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding (i.e., stay the court proceedings) while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Arbitration Process</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Singapore International Arbitration Centre(&ldquo;SIAC&rdquo;) will control any arbitration between you and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited and SIAC&rsquo;s then-current rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, will be used. You can look at SIAC&rsquo;s rules and procedures on their website at https://www.siac.org.sg/. If something in these Terms is different from SIAC&rsquo;s rules and procedures, then the parties agree to follow these Terms instead.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To start an arbitration proceeding, use the form on SIAC&rsquo;s website (www.siac.org.sg).</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you reside outside of the Singapore, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. If you reside in the Singapore, the arbitration shall be initiated in Singapore. You and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Singapore in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the SIAC Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the SIAC Rules.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by SIAC will be governed by the SIAC rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited will advance all filing, administrative, and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by SIAC (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of the relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). If the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited for all such costs and expenses that Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the SIAC rules.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The parties all agree that they will go to court to resolve disputes</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Relating to Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited&rsquo;s intellectual property</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief; or</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Within the jurisdiction of small claims courts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No Class Actions</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your agreement to these Terms), you and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited all agree that the parties can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That means:</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The parties agree that neither you nor Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The parties agree that the arbitrator cannot combine more than one person&rsquo;s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless the parties all agree to change this).</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The parties agree that the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision or award in one person&rsquo;s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited players, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other players.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this subsection on &ldquo;No Class Actions&rdquo; is found to not be enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 14 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver) will be null and void (i.e., go away). But the rest of the Terms and Feature Terms will still apply.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Opting out of the Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Section 14 by sending us written notice of your decision to opt-out through contact@spill.games. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services or availability of this opt-out, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes as set out in this Section 14 . If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited too will not be bound by them.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Changes to Section 14 Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will give you 60-days&rsquo; notice by email or through the Services if we change this Section 14 on our Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver. If this subsection on &ldquo;Changes to Section 14 on Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver&rdquo; is found to not be enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from Section 14 , and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Survival</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Section 14 shall survive termination of these Terms.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">15. APPLICABLE LAW</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you are located in the United States, you agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) governs the interpretation and enforcement of Section 14 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver). Also, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by California law, except for its conflicts of laws principles.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you are located anywhere other than the United States, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by SIAC Rules, except for its conflicts of laws principles.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">16. VENUE FOR LEGAL DISPUTES NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you are located in the United States, judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 14 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless the parties agree to some other location. You and Spillvoy Gaming Private Limited consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you are located anywhere other than the United States, judicial proceedings must be brought in the courts of Bangalore , India unless the parties all agree to some other location.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">17. SEPARATION OF TERMS</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. Except as described in Section 14 under the &ldquo;No Class Actions&rdquo; heading, if any part of these Terms and Feature Terms is not enforceable, the rest of these Terms and Feature Terms still apply and are binding, and any unenforceable term will be substituted with a term that comes as economically close to the unlawful or unenforceable term as possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">18.
