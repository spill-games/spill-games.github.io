					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">When you post, publish, or transmit your observations and

					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">5. MONITORING USE OF SERVICES AND USER CONTENT</span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">We have no obligation to monitor the Services for inappropriate
							or illegal User Content or the conduct of other players, and we take no responsibility
							for such conduct. We also are not responsible for information, materials, products, or
							services provided by other players (for instance, in their profiles) and User Content is

					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">6. YOUR DEALINGS WITH OTHER PLAYERS</span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">If you have a dispute with another player, Spill Games is not
							responsible for any claims, demands, and/or damages of any kind, whether known or
							unknown, resulting from or connected to that dispute. This includes damages for loss of
							profits, goodwill, use, or data. This does not apply to users located in the EEA. If you
							are located in the EEA, your liability vis-&agrave;-vis Spill Games is as set forth by
							the law applicable in the country where you reside.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">As part of the Services, we may offer you the opportunity to play
							with your friends or other matched opponents. To ensure that you always have available
							opponents at the right skill level, some of these matched opponents may be
							auto-generated players that look and play like real people.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">We may allow you to use the Services to initiate SMS or MMS text
							messages to your contacts. You are not required to send such text messages to use our
							Services and standard text messaging and data rates may apply based on your plan with
							your mobile phone carrier. Spill Games does not control the recipients, content, or
							timing of these text messages. If you choose to send text messages through the Services,
							you are confirming that the recipients of the text messages have appropriately consented
							to receive the text messages.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">7. PAYMENT TERMS</span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">We provide some services for real money to obtain a limited
							license and right to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or services.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">How it Works:</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">You get a limited license and right to use Virtual Items by
							visiting the purchase page in one of our games or Services and providing billing
							authorization through the platform on which you are playing (e.g., Facebook, Apple,
							Google).</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">When you make a purchase on any Service offered by Spill Games,
							the payment page will let you know what payment methods you can use to pay when you make
							your purchase. The price of the product will be the price indicated on the order page
							when you place your order. When your purchase is complete, we may send you a
							confirmation email that will have details of the items you have ordered. Please check
							that the details in the confirmation message are correct as soon as possible and keep a
							copy of it for your records. Spill Games keeps records of transactions in order to
							handle any future questions about that transaction.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">When you purchase Virtual Items in our games on other platforms
							such as Facebook, Apple, or Google, Spill Games is not a party to the transaction and
							your purchase will be governed by the third-party platform&rsquo;s payment terms and
							conditions. Please review the platform&rsquo;s terms of service for additional
							information. You can also contact our Billing Support team as described below for
							questions concerning refunds of purchases made through Facebook or Google.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to us to
							obtain a limited license and right to use the relevant Service(s) or Virtual Item(s)
							that will be accepted by us when we accept payment. At that point, the limited license
							begins.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">For orders to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual
							Items, by clicking the purchase/order button on the purchase window or page you:</span>
					</p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">14. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before bringing a formal legal case, you must first contact our
							Customer Support team through support@spill.games. In the event that you and Spill Games
							can&rsquo;t resolve the dispute through Customer Support, you and Spill Games both agree
							to arbitrate as described below.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services
							by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your
							agreement to these Terms), you and Spill Games agree to the fullest extent permitted by
							law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms,
							Feature Terms including but not limited to your use of the Services and information you
							provide via the Services, through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all
							claims under any legal theory unless the claim fits within the Exceptions to Agreement
							to Arbitrate identified below. This agreement to arbitrate also applies even after you
							stop using your account or delete it. (In this Section 14 and in Section 16, you and
							Spill Games may be referred to individually as &ldquo;a party&rdquo; or collectively as
							&ldquo;the parties.&rdquo;)</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead
							of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you, and Spill Games agree
							to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury. Arbitrations have different
							rules from lawsuits in court. They are less formal than lawsuits in courts and provide
							limited opportunities to force the other side to share information relevant to the
							dispute&mdash;a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and
							relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if any party
							does not like the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to
							change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her
							decision.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">If any party disagrees about whether this Section 14 (or any
							portion of this Section 14 including without limitation the provisions relating to
							arbitration, class action waiver, and opting out) can be enforced or whether it applies
							to the dispute, the parties all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too.</span>
					</p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">In addition, if you or Spill Games brings a claim in court that
							should be arbitrated, or any party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be
							arbitrated, any other party can ask a court to force the parties to go to arbitration to
							resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You or Spill Games may also ask a court to
							halt a court proceeding (i.e., stay the court proceedings) while an arbitration
							proceeding is ongoing.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Arbitration Process</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Singapore International Arbitration
							Centre(&ldquo;SIAC&rdquo;) will control any arbitration between you and Spill Games and
							SIAC&rsquo;s then-current rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures
							for Consumer-Related Disputes, will be used. You can look at SIAC&rsquo;s rules and
							procedures on their website at https://www.siac.org.sg/. If something in these Terms is
							different from SIAC&rsquo;s rules and procedures, then the parties agree to follow these
							Terms instead.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">To start an arbitration proceeding, use the form on SIAC&rsquo;s
							website (www.siac.org.sg).</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">If you reside outside of the Singapore, arbitration may take
							place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. If you reside in the
							Singapore, the arbitration shall be initiated in Singapore. You and Spill Games further
							agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Singapore
							in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm,
							modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we
							agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on
							documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person
							hearing as established by the SIAC Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars
							($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the SIAC Rules.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and
							expenses imposed by SIAC will be governed by the SIAC rules, provided that if you are
							initiating an arbitration against Spill Games and the value of the relief sought is ten
							thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then Spill Games will advance all filing,
							administrative, and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by SIAC (subject to
							reimbursement as set forth below). If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply,
							but the value of the relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you
							demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more
							expensive than a court proceeding, then Spill Games will pay the amount of any such
							costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the
							arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to
							reimbursement as set forth below). If the arbitrator determines that all of the claims
							you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11,
							you agree to reimburse Spill Games for all such costs and expenses that Spill Games paid
							and that you would have been obligated to pay under the SIAC rules.</span></p>

					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">The parties all agree that they will go to court to resolve

					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">No Class Actions</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services

							agreement to these Terms), you and Spill Games all agree that the parties can only bring
							a claim against each other on an individual basis.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">That means:</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">The parties agree that neither you nor Spill Games can bring a
							claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or
							representative action.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">The parties agree that the arbitrator cannot combine more than
							one person&rsquo;s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated,
							class, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless the parties all agree to change
							this).</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">The parties agree that the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision or award
							in one person&rsquo;s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other
							Spill Games players, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other
							players.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">If this subsection on &ldquo;No Class Actions&rdquo; is found to
							not be enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 14 (Agreement to Arbitrate and

							decision to opt-out through contact@spill.games. The notice must be sent within thirty
							(30) days of your first use of the Services or availability of this opt-out, whichever
							is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes as set out in this Section
							14 . If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Spill Games too will not be bound
							by them.</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Changes to Section 14 Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action
							Waiver</span></p>
					<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">We will give you 60-days&rsquo; notice by email or through the
							Services if we change this Section 14 on our Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action
							Waiver. If this subsection on &ldquo;Changes to Section 14 on Agreement to Arbitrate and
							Class Action Waiver&rdquo; is found to not be enforceable or valid, then this subsection
							shall be severed from Section 14 , and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first

					<p class="c1"><span class="c2">If you are located in the United States, you agree that these
